Outline of what the alpha beta fit should look like:

 -So the ultimate goal is to slice in energy ( probably 0.1 MeV slices), find
the Pdf of each of the alphas and betas, then attempt to fit to some test
data. The goal is then to use the fit to subtract the alphas from each of the
some other dataset and see what the resulting spectrum looks like.

TODOs:

	- BIG decision: When do you loop over energy.
	- First you need PDFs. 
	- Before that you need to split the MC into 3 sets, training, cross
	  validation and blind. Would be nice if this is variable so get a method.
	-	Think you have 2.5 mil of each, but then you have to think about a radial
		cut*, so 20,60,20 split in data.
	- So then get your pdfs.
		
	- Then run your fits, they should be to hard.
	- The distributions will be Gaussian so shouldn't be that hard but you don't
	  have to worry about that because the PDFs will give shapes and you only need
		normalisations.
	- So now that you have the normalisations what do you do ? 
		+ This is a point and possibility a folk. The normalisation is no good if
			you are not the working on the same size data set! Possibly 20:40:40
			split.
		+ You could fit a functional form but even then you need to to be over the
			same data size.






Ultimate Output:

	- What is the ultimate output. A range of pdfs which spans over energy
	  bins that can be used to subtract alphas and betas. This seems to be run
		length dependent. So will have to be run for each analysis! 


* Could you possible optimise the radial cut? Well you could but how would you
  motivate it.
